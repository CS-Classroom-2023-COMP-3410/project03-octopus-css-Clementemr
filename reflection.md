My design process involved first looking at the index.html file and looking at all of the classes and IDs inside and then making sections for them in the CSS file. I then described what I wanted to chatGPT and saw what he gave me. I then edited chatGPT's results and added more lines to fit the specifications. I did this for each section until I was satisfied and then moved on to the next section. I had 2 main struggles: the first one was that occasionally chatGPT gave me a CSS tag that I didn't know how it worked or what it did, like the flex-box. I had to research this to understand it and even then, it still doesn't look quite like the image. My other struggle was just the quiz section in general because I was never able to get the header above the image. I finished off by adding comments to every line of my CSS code just to make sure I understand everything.
